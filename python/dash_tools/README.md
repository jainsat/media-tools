# Adaptive Video Streaming Over Wireless Networks

# Platform info
Requirements -
Python2/3, linux OS, node, npm <br/>

Following packages/libraries should be installed - <br/>
tensor-flow:<br/>
sudo apt-get -y install python-pip python-dev; sudo pip install tensorflow <br/>

tflearn:<br/>
sudo pip install tflearn ; sudo apt-get -y install python-h5py ; sudo apt-get -y install python-scipy <br/>

matplot lib:
sudo apt-get -y install python-matplotlib

# Steps to run
Have two linux systems(either VM or physical machines). One acts as server and another as client. <br/>

Server config -
1. Start ther node server using - noder server.js. Make sure sever.js is under ~/ path.
2. Verify that manifest.mpd is present under ~/static/ path.
3. Make sure all the video chunks of each rep lives under ~/static/<videoDIR>/
Video files can be downloaded from -â€¨ https://github.com/hongzimao/pensieve/tree/master/video_server

Client - <br/>
To run the client, use the staticdownloader.py. It takes the following args -<br/>
./staticdownloader.py [options] mpdURL [dstDir] <br/>

options - specifies the abr algo and verbosity. <br/>
mpdURL - the url path where the mpd file is hosted at server. Eg. http://10.128.0.33:5000/manifest.mpd. <br/>
dstDir - optional destination directory where the video chunks get downloaded. By default it is, ./download/. <br/>

Eg. - <br/>
To run Simple ABR - <br/>
./staticdownloader.py -v --abr http://10.128.0.33:5000/manifest.mpd <br/>

To run BOLA - <br/>
./staticdownloader.py -v --bola http://10.128.0.33:5000/manifest.mpd <br/>

To run BBA0 - <br/>
./staticdownloader.py -v --bba0 http://10.128.0.33:5000/manifest.mpd <br/>

To run BBA2 -  <br/>
./staticdownloader.py -v --bba2 http://10.128.0.33:5000/manifest.mpd <br/>

To run Pensieve -  <br/>
./staticdownloader.py -v --pensieve http://10.128.0.33:5000/manifest.mpd <br/>

Output - <br/>
On stdout, the time and the video chunk getting downloaded should be displayed. <br/>
At the end, various QoE metrics would be displayed.<br/>
Total play time - Total time video was being played by the video player<br/>
Total played utility - Total utility(log(bitrate)) of all the video chunks.<br/>
Avg played bitrate - Average of all the bitrates of the downloaded chunks.<br/>
Rebuffer time - Total rebuffer time observed.<br/>
Rebuffer count - Total rebuffer count(buffer was empty).<br/>
Next two lines contain two list values that can be copied to plots/plot1.py to generate the graph of comparing all the algos.<br/>
Next four lines specifies the utility values that can be used to generate the plots mentioned in plots/ path.<br/>
plot_average_qoe.py, plot_bitrate.py, plot_rebuffer_penalty.py, plot_smooth.py<br/>
